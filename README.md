# ETG-Olympics_Assignment

1. In first problem we simply print all the unique cities in the .csv file
2. In second problem, we created a separate dataframe for each sport and used that dataframe to count the number of gold medals in the particular sport. Then we append the data in a 2D list and convert that list to dataframe, sort it and plot and represent the top 5 values.
3. In third problem, we just counted the frequency of all the unique sports as each row has one and only one medal. Converted the list to dataframe then sort it in descending order of medals and plot the top 5 values
4. In fourth problem we applied the same logic as problem 3 but used athlete instead of sport
5. In fifth problem we applied the same logic as problem 2 but used athlete instead of sport
6. In sixth problem, we created a dataframe where only country is India. Then we created another dataframe from this dataframe where medal is only gold, and then displayed the head this dataframe
7. In seventh problem, we created a 2D list an filled it with each unique sport and the number of unique athletes in that sport. Then converted the list to dataframe and plot the top 5 values
8. In eighth problem, we created a dataframe with only women, then created another datafarme with only gold medals from this dataframe. Then from this dataframe we created a 2D list with all the unique sports and number of athelete in it, converted the list to dataframe and plot the top 5 values
